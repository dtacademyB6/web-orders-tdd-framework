Singleton Design Pattern -> A design pattern where an instantiation of a class is restricted to only one object.
                           An example could be the Driver class where the Webdriver instantiation is done by getDriver() method that checks if the the WebDriver obj is already initialized.
                           The purpose of using this pattern is to prevent multiple WebDriver objects being initialized.

Page Object Model Design Pattern -> A design pattern specific to Selenium based test frameworks which is implemented by creating a separate class for each page of our
                                    application which stores the page web elements and methods.
                                    The purpose is re-usability, maintainability and readability.

PageFactory design pattern ->      This pattern uses @FindBy annotations to locate the elements and makes our Page classes more readable and concise.
                                   We implement it by using PageFactory.initElements() method in a constructor of the page class
                                   We also can use @FindBys to create chained matches and @FindAll to match multiple webelements on the page


 Maven plugin vs dependency ->     Dependency -> collection of libraries(jar files) that is used for specific purpose
                                   Plugin -> Maven tool that executes specific task. Maven Surefire plugin executes tests
